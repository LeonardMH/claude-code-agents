# Claude Code Agents

A specialized collection of focused agents for software development workflows.
Each agent handles a specific aspect of development with clear boundaries and
inter-agent communication capabilities.

## Agent Architecture

Agents are organized by color according to their role in the software development lifecycle and use different Claude models based on their complexity requirements:

| Color | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| ðŸŸ£ Purple | Planning & Architecture | Opus |
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Building & Implementation | Sonnet |
| ðŸ”µ Blue | Knowledge & Documentation | Sonnet, Haiku |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Quality Assurance | Sonnet, Haiku |
| ðŸŸ  Orange | Operations & Monitoring | Sonnet |
| ðŸ”´ Red | Incident Response | Opus, Haiku, Sonnet |

## Agent Communication

All agents communicate through the `.agent-handoffs/` shared workspace using structured markdown files with the naming convention `<agent-role-name>-<short-uuid>.md`. This system enables:

- **Context preservation**: Each agent documents findings, decisions, and recommendations
- **Coordinated workflows**: Agents read relevant handoffs before starting work
- **Knowledge sharing**: Historical analysis and implementation context passed between agents
- **Quality tracking**: Implementation details and testing needs communicated across the pipeline

### Handoff File Structure
Each handoff file contains:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of work completed
- **Key Findings**: Important discoveries or results
- **Context for Next Agent**: What the next agent needs to know
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions or considerations
- **Files/Components Affected**: Relevant code locations with line numbers

See `handoff-system.md` for complete documentation and agent-specific handoff patterns.

## Installation
